## **DESCRIPTION**

A Web Application and android application that provide people with alternative options for managing their health and wellness, by offering home remedies and Ayurvedic products and empowering individuals to take control of their own health and explore natural solutions for different ailments.

## **TECHNOLOGY STACK**

1. In this project, different technologies and tools have been used to develop a web application and an Android application.
2. The frontend languages are the ones used to create the user interface and client-side logic for the web application. These languages typically include **ReactJS, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript**. The ReactJS, HTML and CSS are used for creating the structure and design of the website, respectively, while JavaScript is used for adding dynamic behavior to the website.
3. **Firebase** is a backend service that provides various features like authentication, database, storage, and hosting. In this project, Firebase has been used as the backend service to store and manage data for the web application.
4. For identifying the diseases keyword in the search engine, we have used the search query that uses an algorithm to search through its database of indexed web pages and return a list of results that are relevant to the user's query.
5. **Flutter** is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to build apps for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. In this project, the Android application has been developed using Flutter, which provides a fast and efficient way to create mobile applications with a native look and feel.
6. For Hosting we are using **Google Cloud Platform's Virtual Machine** which we have created using the N2D-standard-2 Machine Type along with CPU platform with AMD Rome, whose architecture is x86/64 hosted in destination Zone us-central1-a.
7. We have purchased the domain www.vedicheal.live from https://www.name.com/ and created a DNS record mapped to the External IP 35.224.70.142 of our Vedicheal-2 VM instance.
